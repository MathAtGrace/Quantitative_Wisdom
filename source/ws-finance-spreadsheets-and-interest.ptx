            Sage deposited $2498 into an account paying 7.05% APR, compounded quarterly. Dionne deposited $2994 into an account paying 5.19% APR, compounded monthly. How many years will it take for their balances to (nearly) match?
          </p>
          <p>
            Make a spreadsheet with <q>Year</q> in Column A, and spreadsheet formulas for each person, using a cell reference for the year. Then you can copy the formula down using the fill-down feature.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          Their balances are about the same after 10 years. Dionne starts out with a higher deposit but after 10 years, Sage passes her due to the higher interest rate.
