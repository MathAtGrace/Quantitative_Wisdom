            A data scientist has been counting the number of trick-or-treaters that come to his house every year. We will analyze the shape, center and spread of this data.  Source: <url href="https://www.dataplusscience.com/HalloweenData.html"/>

            <p>
              Make a histogram of the number of trick-or-treaters using a bin-width of 100 trick-or-treaters.  Save room to make a boxplot right below it, but not yet. Follow the steps in order. Label your axes.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are doing this in class, then actually draw the histogram (and later, the boxplot) by hand.  If you are doing this online, then space has been provided to copy and paste them below.  A great resource is <url href="https://www.statskingdom.com/histogram-maker.html"/>

            The shape is bimodal, but skewness is hard to determine.  The histogram we made gives a bigger left tail, but the mean is larger than the median.

          The test scores for class 1 are approximately symmetric with a mean of 79.3 points and a standard deviation of 13.35 points. The student who scored 55 points may be an outlier.

        <solution>
          Class 1 had a slightly higher mean (79.3 vs 78.4 points) and median (79.5 vs 78 points) and students scored higher, but some students also scored lower. It could be said that Class 1 did better. It could also be said that Class 2 did better because they have a smaller range (29 vs 44 points) and standard deviation (9.58 vs 13.34 points), so their scores were less spread out and more consistent. The lowest score in class 2 was 65. The lowest score in Class 1 was 55 points which may be an outlier due to a student having a bad day, illness or emergency, etc.
