            In Exercise 9, we are making loan payments that include interest in addition to the principal of $315,000. The present value is $315,000 and the future value is $0.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is different because we switched the present value to $0 and the future value to $315,000. In this case we would be depositing $414.81 per month to save up to $315,000. Interest is working with us instead of against us.
