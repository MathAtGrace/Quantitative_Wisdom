              We have immediate need for five enthusiastic self-starters who love the outdoors and who love people.  Our salespeople make an average of $1,000 per week. Come join the winning team.

            Sets B, D, and E have a median (middle value) of $240,000, but all the values in Set D are below $295,000 so it would be impossible for that set to have a mean of $295,000. So sets B and E are the only two that could have the same mean and median shown in the graph for 2005.
