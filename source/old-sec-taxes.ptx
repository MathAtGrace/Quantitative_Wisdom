  <title>Income Tax Worksheet</title>
  <p>
    This worksheet is based on Lesson 2.1 from Quantway 1 remixed by Pierce Community College.  Dr. Ryan Johnson updated the tax code to 2021, added other necessary details, and re-wrote the last two questions to focus on spreadsheets instead of algebra.

        <p>
          In the United States, people pay income tax on any income they earn during the year.  The total amount of money they earn through work, investments, and other means is called <em>total income</em>.  From this, people are able to deduct certain things, like retirement contributions and tuition payments, reducing their income to what is called their <em>adjusted gross income</em>.  From this, certain expenses can be deducted resulting in the <em>taxable income</em> that tax is actually calculated on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taxes can be, as you've probably heard, fairly complicated, but for this lesson we are going to focus on a simple case: a couple we'll name Gracie and Lancel.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gracie and Lancel are married with no kids, filing jointly.  No one can claim either as a dependent.</li>
          <li>Together, they earned $106,900 of wage income</li>
          <li>They did <em>not</em> earn anything from interest, dividends, distributions, annuities, benefits, capital gains, or anything else.</li>
          <li>They plan to take the standard deduction.</li>
          <li>They contributed more than $600 to their church (According to instructions from the IRS, for a couple filing jointly who take the standard deduction, the maximum amount they can claim is $600).</li>
          <li>They had no qualified business income</li>
          <li>They can claim $2250 in adjustments to income because Gracie is an elementary teacher who can mark $250 for educator expenses and they can claim $2000 because of their payments toward the interest of their student loans.</li>
        </ul>

              Usually tax owed is looked up from a tax table. You would use the first line of the table if the taxable income from line 6  is at least 72,000 but less than 72,050.
              <ol>
                <li>Write this as a compound inequality, using t to represent the income from line 6.</li>
                <li>Then use the table provided to determine the tax the couple owes.</li>

              <me>78150 \leq t &lt; 78200</me>

        Alternatively, the couple could calculate the tax based on tax rate information.  A portion of the rate table from 2022 is shown.

        The rates you see on the right (10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, 37%) are called <em>marginal tax rates</em>, but most people just call them <em>tax brackets</em>.
      </p>
      <exercise xml:id="exercise-taxes-4" workspace="1in">
        <statement>
          Use the tax rates above to calculate the couple's tax.  Does it match the tax table?
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>Taxable income is not over $83,550, so we'll use the second row</p>
          <p>Tax will be $2,055 plus 12% of the excess over $20,550</p>
          <p>$78,150 - $20,550 = $57,600 excess</p>
          <p>12% of $57,600 = $6,912</p>
          <p>$2,055 + $6,912 = $8,967</p>

          <p>It's off by $3, because the table is providing an average value based on the range of taxable incomes.  But it's close enough to tell the two are consistent.</p>

        Sometimes people have been hesitant to accept raises, worried that it will push them into a new tax bracket and they'll end up losing money.

        <statement>
          Suppose the couple got an unexpected $6,000 bonus at the end of the year, pushing them into the 22% marginal rate tax bracket. How much tax will they pay?
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>Taxable income will now be $84,150, so the tax will now be calculated using</p>

          <p>$84,150-$83,550 = $800 excess.  22% of $800 = $176</p>

        <solution>
          <p>Original: $106,900 income - $8,970 taxes = $97,930 take home pay.</p>

        While tax tables and the tax rates work well for calculating tax for a single individual, a business might want to create a spreadsheet that automatically calculates the tax for their employees.

      <p>
        For simplicity, let's assume all of the employees are married and filing jointly, and all of their taxable incomes fall between $20,551 and $83,550.  Let's also assume that they will take the standard deduction, have no other income, make no adjustments to their taxable income, and give nothing to charity.  These assumptions will be close enough for this company's purposes.
