        <ul>
          <li>Read, interpret, and make decisions based upon data from tables and graphical displays such as line graphs, bar graphs, scatterplots, pie charts, and histograms. Given data, choose an appropriate type of graphical display and create it using scales appropriate to the application.</li>

      <introduction>
        Graphs are a helpful way to summarize data. Often there are many ways to portray information graphically. Sometimes one form is easier to read than another. Sometimes the way a graph is made can affect the impression it gives. Today, you will look at three examples of such graphs.

            Looking at the graph, the value is between $52,000 and $52,500, but much closer to $52,500. About $52,400.

          In this example, we will be looking at bar graphs.  Before doing that, answer the question about Jeff’s Housing so that you can understand the questions about national debt and GDP that follow.

        <exercise xml:id="exercise-charts-6">
          <statement>
            Jeff’s Housing: Two pairs of statements are given below.

                    <line>
                      In 2010, Jeff spent $1,400 per month on housing.

                      In 1990, Jeff spent 20% of his income on housing.

              </tabular>
            </table>
            How can both pairs of statements be true?  Circle the correct one.
            <ul>
              <li>It is not possible for both statements to be true, since one shows his housing costs rising, and the other shows his housing costs decreasing</li>
              <li>Both statements can be true if his income increased significantly from 1990 to 2010</li>
              <li>Both statements can be true if his income fell significantly from 1990 to 2010</li>
            </ul>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            Both statements can be true if his income increased significantly from 1990 to 2010, so that even though he was spending more money on housing, it was a smaller part of his much larger income.

            <p>
              In 1990, $700 was 20% of his income, so 0.20(income) = $700. His income was $700/0.20 = $3,500

            <p>
              In 2010, $1,400 was 10% of his income, so 0.10(income) = $1,400. His income was $1,400/0.10 = $14,000

            GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, can be thought of as the country’s income. It is the value of all goods and services the country produces. The national debt is how much the country owes. Just as Jeff’s spending on housing can be calculated as a percent of income, a country’s national debt can be calculated as a percent of its GDP.

          <statement>
            Using the graphs above, what was the national debt in 2010? What percent of the GDP was the national debt in 2010?

          <solution>
            <p>
              In the first graph, notice that the vertical scale is labeled in increments of 2 (0, 2, 4, 6, etc.) with 4 divisions between, so each mark is 0.5. The national debt for 2010 is one mark below 14, so that would be 13.5 trillion dollars.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the second graph, notice that the vertical scale is labeled in increments of 10 with 5 divisions between, so each mark is 2. The bar for 2010 is one mark above 60, so that would be 62%.

            <ul>
              <li>The total debt has never been higher, but as a percentage of income debt was not at the highest level ever in 2010</li>
