</ul></article><section class="introduction" id="introduction-2"><p id="p-6">Welcome to Quantitative Reasoning.  The goal of this course is to teach you how to use and understand numbers (quantitative) to understand the world and think for yourself (reasoning).  However, this book is also written from a Christian perspective, and we find in scripture the most commmonly used word for learning to understand and live according to God's created order is <em class="emphasis">wisdom</em>.  This course will strongly resemble Quantitative Reasoning courses found in secular colleges and universities, but ocassionally our Christian perspective will break through in ways different from or contrary to a secular perspecive.</p>
<p id="p-7">This is a math course designed for students who are majoring in fields that do not <em class="emphasis">directly</em> require a lot of mathematics.  Dr. Eric Gaze at Bowdoin College summarizes Quantitative Reasoning as “doing complicated reasoning using elementary mathematics.”  Most of the topics are intended to help you better understand adult life, be a better citizen, and better understand ethical questions with numerical components.</p>
<p id="p-8">One of the most important things you need to succeed in this class is patience and determination.  As Keith Plummer, a professor of apologetics, theology, and counseling at Cairn University once said, “The speed with which we're able to communicate can tempt us to view precision and those who value it with impatient disdain.” Although we will sometimes work only in terms of estimation, a great deal of this course will be spent patiently and diligently figuring out answers that might surprise us.  As you work hard in this class I hope that you improve in the Biblical virtues of patience, understanding <a href="" data-knowl="" class="id-ref fn-knowl original" data-refid="hk-fn-2" id="fn-2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>, discipline, and diligence.<a href="" data-knowl="" class="id-ref fn-knowl original" data-refid="hk-fn-3" id="fn-3"><sup> 3 </sup></a></p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-1"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

</h4>Why did God give people the capacity to do mathematics?  Before reading any further, write a couple of sentences giving your answer to this question. If all you can think of is “I have no idea!”, take your best guess, even if it seems silly to you.<div class="workspace" data-space="1in"></div></article><p id="p-14">The following statements have been made during the past 4,000 years.  They suggest possible answers to the question of why we should study math.  Most are by famous and influential people.  As you read each one, fill in the first column of the table linked below, “What reason for studying math does this suggest?”  These quotes are rich and many good things could be said about them, so aim for one good point for each.  You will work in groups to fill in the rest of each row; we’ve done one as an example.  Note the column “Is this a good reason?” Some quotes provide reasons that are partly good and partly bad.</p>

The Bible uses numbers frequently, but does not speak directly about mathematics.  Nevertheless, we can take several statements the Bible makes about God’s plans and purposes and apply them to the study of math.  After each quote, summarize its main ideas in your own words and apply them to the study of math.</p>

<p id="p-40">You do not see the name of the organization that put up the billboard. What groups might have wanted to publish this statement? What are some social issues or political ideas that this statement might support?</p>
<p id="p-41">This question does not have a "right" answer, or even a numerical answer. The goal here is for you to think about the question, and write up a response. You will earn full credit as long as your answer is reasonable and on-topic.</p>

<p id="p-42">The information in this statement is called <em class="emphasis">quantitative</em>. Quantitative information uses concepts about quantity or number. This can be specific numbers or a pattern based on numerical relationships such as doubling.</p>
<p id="p-43">You hear and see statements using quantitative information every day. People use these statements as evidence to convince you to do things like</p>
<ul class="disc">

</ul>
<p id="p-44">You often do not know whether these statements are true. You may not be able to locate the information, but you can start by asking if the statement is reasonable. This means to ask if the statements make sense. You will be asked if information is <em class="emphasis">reasonable</em> throughout this course.
