<p id="p-18">We are bombarded by information and statistics every day. But if we cannot distinguish credible information from misleading information, then we are vulnerable to manipulation and making decisions that are not in our best interest. Statistics provides tools for us to evaluate information critically. In this sense, statistics is one of the most important things to know about.</p>
<p id="p-19">Statistics are often presented to add credibility to an argument. To give some examples, here are some claims that we have heard on several occasions. (We are not saying that each one of these claims is true!)</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li id="li-6"><p id="p-20">4 out of 5 dentists recommend Dentyne.</p></li>
<li id="li-7"><p id="p-21">Almost 85% of lung cancers in men and 45% in women are tobacco-related.</p></li>
<li id="li-8"><p id="p-22">Condoms are effective 94% of the time.</p></li>
<li id="li-9"><p id="p-23">People tend to be more persuasive when they look others directly in the eye and speak loudly and quickly.</p></li>
<li id="li-10"><p id="p-24">Women make 75 cents to every dollar a man makes when they work the same job.</p></li>
<li id="li-11"><p id="p-25">A surprising new study shows that eating egg whites can increase one's life span.</p></li>
<li id="li-12"><p id="p-26">People predict that it is very unlikely there will ever be another baseball player with a batting average over 400.</p></li>
<li id="li-13"><p id="p-27">There is an 80% chance that in a room full of 30 people that at least two people will share the same birthday.</p></li>
<li id="li-14"><p id="p-28">79.48% of all statistics are made up on the spot.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="p-29">All these claims are statistical in character. We suspect that some of them sound familiar; if not, you have probably heard other claims like them. Notice how diverse the examples are; they come from psychology, health, law, sports, business, etc. Data and data-interpretation show up in virtually every facet of contemporary life.</p>
<p id="p-30">Many of these numbers do not represent careful statistical analysis. They can be misleading and push you into decisions that you might regret. This chapter will help you learn the skills to be a critical consumer of statistical claims.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-1"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

</h3>
<p id="p-32">Before we begin gathering any data to analyze, we need to identify the population we are studying. The population of a study is the group we want to know something about. The <em class="alert">population</em> could be people, auto parts or tomato plants.</p>
<p id="p-33">If we want to know the amount of money spent on textbooks by a typical college student, our population might be all students at Portland Community College. Or it might be:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li id="li-15"><p id="p-34">All community college students in the state of Oregon.</p></li>
<li id="li-16"><p id="p-35">All students at public colleges and universities in the state of Oregon.</p></li>
<li id="li-17"><p id="p-36">All students at all colleges and universities in the state of Oregon.</p></li>
<li id="li-18"><p id="p-37">All students at all colleges and universities in the entire United States.</p></li>
<li id="li-19"><p id="p-38">And so on.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="p-39">The intended population is also called the <em class="alert">target population</em>, since if we design our study badly, the collected data might not actually be representative of the intended population.</p>

<p id="p-42">A <em class="alert">parameter</em> is the value (percentage, average, etc.) that we are interested in for the whole population. Since it is often too time-consuming, expensive and/or impossible to get data for the entire population, the parameter is usually a theoretical quantity that we are trying to estimate. For example, the typical amount of money spent per year on textbooks by students at your college in a year is a parameter.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-4"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<p id="p-43">To estimate the parameter, we select a <em class="alert">sample</em>, which is a smaller subset of the entire population. It is very important that we choose a <em class="alert">representative sample</em>, one that matches the characteristics of the population, to have a good estimate. If we survey 100 students at your college, those students would be our sample. We will talk about how to choose a representative sample later in this section.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-5"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

</h3>
<p id="p-50">As we mentioned in a previous section, the first thing we should do before conducting a survey is to identify the population that we want to study. Suppose we are hired by a politician to determine the amount of support they have among the electorate should they decide to run for another term. What population should we study? Every person in the district? Eligible voters might be better, but what if they don’t register? Registered voters may not vote. What about “likely voters?”</p>
<p id="p-51">This is the criteria used in a lot of political polling, but it is sometimes difficult to define a “likely voter.” Here is an example of the challenges of political polling.</p>
<article class="example example-like" id="example-3"><h4 class="heading">
<span class="type">Example</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">1.1.4</span><span class="period">.</span>
</h4>
<p id="p-52">In November 1998, former professional wrestler Jesse "The Body" Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota. Up until right before the election, most polls showed he had little chance of winning. There were several contributing factors to the polls not reflecting the actual intent of the electorate:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li id="li-20"><p id="p-53">Ventura was running on a third-party ticket and most polling methods are better suited to a two-candidate race.</p></li>
<li id="li-21"><p id="p-54">Many respondents to polls may have been embarrassed to tell pollsters that they were planning to vote for a professional wrestler.</p></li>
<li id="li-22"><p id="p-55">The mere fact that the polls showed Ventura had little chance of winning might have prompted some people to vote for him in protest to send a message to the major-party candidates.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="p-56">But one of the major contributing factors was that Ventura recruited a substantial amount of support from young people, particularly college students, who had never voted before and who registered specifically to vote in that election. The polls did not deem these young people likely voters (since in most cases young people have a lower rate of voter registration and a lower turnout rate for elections) so the polling samples were subject to <em class="alert">sampling bias</em>: they omitted a portion of the electorate that was weighted in favor of the winning candidate.</p></article><p id="p-57">So, identifying the population can be a difficult job, but once we have identified the population, how do we choose a good sample? We want our statistic to estimate the parameter we are interested in, so we need to have a representative sample. Returning to our hypothetical job as a political pollster, we would not anticipate very accurate results if we drew all of our samples from customers at a Starbucks, or your list of TikTok followers. How do we get a sample that resembles our population?</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-7"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">1.1.7</span> <span class="title">Sampling Methods</span>
</h3>
<p id="p-58">One way to get a representative sample is to use randomness. We will look at three types of sampling that use <em class="emphasis">randomness</em> and one that does not.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-8"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<p id="p-59">A <em class="alert">simple random sample</em>, abbreviated SRS, is one in which every member of the population has an equal probability of being chosen.</p>

<p id="p-60">If we could somehow identify all likely voters in the state, put each of their names on a piece of paper, toss the slips into a (very large) hat and draw 1000 slips out of the hat, we would have a simple random sample.</p></article><p id="p-61">In practice, computers are better suited for this sort of endeavor. It is always possible, however, that even a random sample might end up not being totally representative of the population. If we repeatedly take samples of 1000 people from among the population of likely voters in the state of Oregon, some of these samples might tend to have a slightly higher percentage of Democrats (or Republicans) than  the general population; some samples might include more older people and some samples might include more younger people; etc. This is called <em class="alert">sampling variation</em>. If there are certain groups that we want to make sure are represented, we might instead use a stratified sample.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-9"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">1.1.9</span> <span class="title">Stratified sampling</span>
</h3>
<p id="p-62">In <em class="alert">stratified sampling</em>, a population is divided into a number of subgroups (or strata). Random samples are then taken from each subgroup. It is often desirable to make the sample sizes proportional to the size of each subgroup in the population.</p>
<article class="example example-like" id="example-5"><h4 class="heading">
<span class="type">Example</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">1.1.6</span><span class="period">.</span>
</h4>
<p id="p-63">Suppose that data from voter registrations in the state indicated that the electorate was comprised of 39% Democrats, 37% Republicans and 24% Independents. In a sample of 1000 people, they would then expect to get about 390 Democrats, 370 Republicans and 240 Independents. To accomplish this, they could randomly select 390 people from among those voters known to be Democrats, 370 from those known to be Republicans, and 240 from those with no party affiliation.</p></article><p id="p-64">A way to remember stratified sampling is think about having a piece of layer cake.

Systematic sampling is not as random as a simple random sample (if your ID number is right next to your friend’s because you applied at the same time, you could not both end up in the same sample) but it can yield acceptable samples. This method can be useful for people waiting in lines, parts on a manufacturing line, or plants in a row.</p></article></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-11"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

We talked about <em class="alert">sampling</em> or <em class="alert">selection bias</em>, which is when the sample is not representative of the population. One example of this is <em class="alert">voluntary response bias</em>, which is bias introduced by only collecting data from those who volunteer to participate.

<p id="p-117">Even when a study or experiment has successfully avoided bias and has been well done, there is still an element of variation. If we took 5 different random samples of 100 college students and calculated their average textbook cost, we wouldn’t expect to get the exact same average for each sample. This is due to sampling variation. To account for this, researchers publish their margin of error or a confidence interval for their statistics. These numbers describe the precision of the estimate for a certain confidence level.</p>
<p id="p-118">You’ve probably heard something like, “The candidate has 54 percent of the likely voters, plus or minus three percent.” The 3% is called the <em class="alert">margin of error</em>, so the true percentage is somewhere between 51% and 57%, with a certain level of confidence. To write this as a <em class="alert">confidence interval</em>, we place the numbers in parentheses from smallest to largest, separated by a comma: (51%, 57%).</p>
<p id="p-119">The most common <em class="alert">confidence level</em> is 95%, which means if the poll was conducted repeatedly, and we made a confidence interval each time, we would expect the true percentage, or parameter, to fall within our confidence interval 95 out of 100 times.
