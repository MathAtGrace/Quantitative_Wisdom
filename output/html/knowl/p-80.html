<p>You will use a measure of water consumption called a “water footprint” that includes all of the ways that people use fresh water. According to Waterwiki.net, “The water footprint of an individual, business, or nation is defined as the total volume of freshwater that is used to produce the goods and services consumed by the individual, business, or nation.” Goods are physical products such as food, clothes, books, or cars. Services are types of work done by other people. Examples of services are having your hair cut, having a mechanic fix your car, or having someone provide day care for your children. Fresh water is often used to make goods and to provide you with services.</p>
