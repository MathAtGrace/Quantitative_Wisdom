<p>The first colonists arrived in America in 1607 and African people who had been violently separated from their families and homeland were brought to Jamestown in 1619 as slaves. Slave labor was used on tobacco and cotton plantations, for domestic work and even as part of the labor for building the White House. The system of slavery was an integral part of the United States economic and political system (How Slavery Helped Build a World Economy, 2003). <p></p> At the same time, white settlements kept encroaching on the homeland of Native Americans. Many treaties were signed and then violated. For example, in 1785, the <em class="alert">Treaty of Hopewell</em> was signed with the Cherokees in Georgia, which set a boundary on white settlement, but there were already colonists past that border.</p>
