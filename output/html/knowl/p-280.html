<p>(Challenge) Imagine the opening balance of the account was $5000.00 instead of $1000.00 (and everything else about the account stays the same). Make a similar spreadsheet as you did in part (d), and using this spreadsheet, find the minimum number of full years you will have to wait this time, until the balance finally exceeds twice its opening deposit amount. How does this answer compare with your answer in part (d)? Do you think your answer would be the same here, for any positive opening balance you may choose for the account?</p>
