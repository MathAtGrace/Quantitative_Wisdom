<p>There is no way to correct for biased data, so it is very important to think through the entire study and data analysis before we start. We talked about <em class="alert">sampling</em> or <em class="alert">selection bias</em>, which is when the sample is not representative of the population. One example of this is <em class="alert">voluntary response bias</em>, which is bias introduced by only collecting data from those who volunteer to participate.
