<p>Plan and budget for the giant Centennial cake to be displayed on Beta field for the first two weeks of the school year.  The decorative (but non-edible) cake is to measure 15 feet in diameter.  The President of the College did not specify a particular height for the giant cake; he merely asked that it be of reasonable “cake proportions.” The specifics are up to you. The hollow, decorative cake is to be made of a wooden frame covered with plywood and is to be filled with red, black, and white helium balloons.  (The balloons will be released at the end of the dinner party.)  You need to provide the specific design instructions for making this cake and need to budget for its construction, decoration, and filling (with the appropriate number of balloons).  Students will make the cake, so there’s no need to budget for labor, only for materials.</p>
