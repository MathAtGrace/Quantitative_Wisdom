<p>The U.S. government was officially formed in 1787. During the <em class="alert">Constitutional Convention</em>, the framers were tasked with making decisions on the three branches of government and how people (or those considered to be people) would be represented. At that time only white men with property were allowed to vote. Women were also considered to be property of their husband at the time.</p>
