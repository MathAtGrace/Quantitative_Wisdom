<p>There are four corners, plus 2 posts on each side of the two gates, for a total of 8 corner posts. 8 posts at $20 each = $160.</p>
<p>The top is 140 feet, and 140/8 = 17.5, so 17 inline posts will be needed. The right-hand side is 115 feet, and 115/8 = 14.375, so 14 posts will be needed. The bottom side is 130 feet, and 130/8 = 16.25, so 16 posts will be needed. The left side above the house is 25-4 = 21 feet, and 21/8 = 2.625, so 2 posts will be needed. The left side below the house is 40-4=36 feet, and 36/8 = 4.5, so 4 posts are needed. Altogether, 17+14+16+2+4 = 53 inline posts will be needed. 53 posts at $12.50 each is $662.50</p>
<p>The top requires 140 feet of fence, the right side 115 feet, the bottom 130 feet. The left side above the house will need 25-4 = 21 feet, and the left side below the house 40-4 = 36 feet. Altogether, 140+115+130+21+36 = 442 feet of fencing. 442 feet at $7 per foot = $3094</p>
<p>2 gates at $75 each = $150. The total cost is $160 + $662.50 + $3094 + $150 = $4066.50 before tax, and $4066.50 + 0.094(4066.50) = 4448.75 after tax</p>
