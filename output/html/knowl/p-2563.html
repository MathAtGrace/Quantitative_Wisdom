<p>From the upper boxplot we can see that this distribution is skewed to the right and the upper quarter of the data is very spread out. It is natural to think of the data values as being evenly spread out in each region, but that is quite often not the case. From the lower boxplot we can see that there are 4 data values that are considered outliers and how far away the last data value is from the others. This is why it is useful to show outliers on a boxplot.</p>
