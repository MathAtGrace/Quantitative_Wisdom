The boxplot for Store 2 shows a 5-number summary of 0.5, 1.1, 2.1, 5.7, 9.6 minutes."></div></div></div>
<p>Store 2 has a slightly shorter median service time (2.1 minutes vs. 2.3 minutes), but the service times are less consistent, with a wider spread of the data.</p>
<p>The 75th percentiles are 2.9 and 5.7 minutes. That means at store 1, 75% of customers were served within 2.9 minutes, while at store 2, 75% of customers were served within 5.7 minutes.</p>
<p>Which store should you go to in a hurry? That depends upon your opinion about luck â€“ 25% of customers at store 2 had to wait between 5.7 and 9.6 minutes.</p>
