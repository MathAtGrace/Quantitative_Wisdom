<p>Dr. Blackwell grew up in Centralia, Ill. In school, he was intrigued by geometry and calculus. His high school math club advisor would challenge members with problems from the School Science and Mathematics journal and submit their solutions. Blackwell was identified three times in the magazine as having solved problems and one of his solutions was published (David Harold Blackwell: National Visionary Leadership Project: African American History, 2013).</p>
