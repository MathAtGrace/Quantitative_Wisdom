<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like"><p>The tax credit will reduce his tax bill by the full amount of the credit, so the $1,000 tax credit will reduce his tax bill by $1,000. As a deduction, however, his contribution to charity will only reduce his tax bill by 22% of the $1,000, or 0.22($1,000) = $220. Tax credits are always better than deductions.</p></div></body>
