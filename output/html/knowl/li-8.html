</h6>Schedule your Intensive Study Time for each class. Try to schedule some study time each day for each class. Learning is more effectively and efficiently accomplished in shorter, regular sessions than in longer irregular sessions. When you schedule study time, be task-oriented rather than time-oriented. In other words, focused on what needs to get done for your classes (homework, reading, labs, WAMAP, etc.)  Think in terms of "blocks of time" and what specifically needs to be accomplished, not hours of study time. Try to study the same subjects at the same time each study day. Although this seems to be a mechanical way of scheduling, you will find that such a routine can help you develop a pattern for efficient and effective learning.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="time.html#li-8" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
