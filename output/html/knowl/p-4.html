<p>Welcome to Quantitative Reasoning.  The goal of this course is to teach you how to use and understand numbers (quantitative) to understand the world and think for yourself (reasoning).  However, this book is also written from a Christian perspective, and we find in scripture the most commmonly used word for learning to understand and live according to God's created order is <em class="emphasis">wisdom</em>.  This course will strongly resemble Quantitative Reasoning courses found in secular colleges and universities, but ocassionally our Christian perspective will break through in ways different from or contrary to a secular perspecive.</p>
