</h5>
<p>Suppose researchers at a small two-year college surveyed students who have credit cards and report the following:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Mean credit card debt of $350 for 114 freshmen surveyed</p></li>
<li><p>Mean credit card debt of $285 for 220 sophomores surveyed</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If we want to know overall for all the surveyed students what their mean credit card debt was, we cannot simply average $350 and $285 since these numbers are not equally “weighted”. The $350 was an average for only 114 people while the $285 was an average for a larger group of 220 people.  The way to find the overall average credit card debt for all students surveyed is to multiply each of the values by its “weight” or “frequency” or “importance” before adding them together, and then divide by the total “weight” or “frequency”.</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\text{Overall mean} = \frac{350(114)+285(220)}{114+220} = \frac{102600}{334} = 307.19 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Conclude:  The mean credit card debt of all the students surveyed was about $307</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="average.html#example-mean-credit-card-debt" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
