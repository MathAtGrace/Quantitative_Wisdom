<p>Plan and budget for the elaborate dinner party for the entire Grace College Community (students, faculty, and staff).  Appetizers, main courses (regular, vegetarian, and allergen-free), dessert, and beverages are to be provided.  Before the College approaches specific catering services, you need to pull together and neatly present relevant details about the expected college communityâ€™s population (e.g., percent with food allergies, percent who will drink water vs more expensive drinks, total population size, etc.) to estimate the amount and types of food and drink needed.  You also need to provide fairly detailed estimates of expenses for the food and drink desired and for the hourly service fees for the servers and any other relevant expenses.</p>
