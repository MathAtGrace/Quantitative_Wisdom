</h4>
<div class="introduction">
<p>A revolving line of credit is an agreement between a consumer and lender that allows the consumer to obtain credit for an undetermined amount of time. The debt is repaid periodically and can be borrowed again once it is repaid. The use of a credit card is an example of a revolving line of credit.</p>
<p>U.S. consumers own more than 600 million credit cards.  As of 2015 the average credit card debt per household with a credit card was $15,863.  In total, American consumers owe $901 billion in credit card debt.  Worldwide the number of credit card transactions at merchants was over 135 billion in 2011.</p>
<p>Surveys indicate that the percentage of college freshmen with a credit card was 21% in 2012, while 60% of college seniors had a credit card.  One-third of the college students reported having a zero balance on their credit card.   The average balance carried across all students’ cards was $500.  However, the median balance was $136.</p>
<p>At www.creditcards.com it explains that card issuers divide customers into two groups:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>"transactors" who use their cards for purchases and pay off the balances each month.  Transactors pay off the balance before any interest charges are applied.</p></li>
<li><p>"revolvers" who carry balances on their cards, paying interest charges month to month.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The number of people who carry credit card debt, the “revolvers”, has been steadily decreasing in the U.S. since 2009.  By 2014 only one-third of adults surveyed said their household carries credit card debt.  Fifteen percent of adults carry $2,500 or more in credit card debt each month.</p>
<p>In the first part of this lesson, you will use the information about credit cards given above to learn about some ways to summarize quantitative information.</p>
