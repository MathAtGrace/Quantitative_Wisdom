<p>Bilqis gets a credit card, with 17.99% APR compounding daily. She uses the card to buy a $900 plane ticket.  She does not make any payments during the interest-free grace period. Her first payment is due 35 days after the grace period ended. Following the fine print in the credit card agreement, the minimum payment is calculated to be 1% of the outstanding balance after applying the APR; or $25, whichever is larger. What is her outstanding balance? What is her minimum payment? If she pays the minimum payment what will her new balance be?</p>
