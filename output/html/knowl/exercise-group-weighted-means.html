</h4>
<div class="introduction">
<p>Sometimes you want to find the mean average of some numbers, but the numbers are not “equally important” or in other words they don’t have the same “weight” or “frequency”.  In that case we find the “weighted average” of the numbers.</p>
<article class="example example-like"><h5 class="heading">
<span class="type">Example</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">4.2.9</span><span class="period">.</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="title">mean credit card debt:.</span>
</h5>
<p>Suppose researchers at a small two-year college surveyed students who have credit cards and report the following:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Mean credit card debt of $350 for 114 freshmen surveyed</p></li>
<li><p>Mean credit card debt of $285 for 220 sophomores surveyed</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If we want to know overall for all the surveyed students what their mean credit card debt was, we cannot simply average $350 and $285 since these numbers are not equally “weighted”. The $350 was an average for only 114 people while the $285 was an average for a larger group of 220 people.  The way to find the overall average credit card debt for all students surveyed is to multiply each of the values by its “weight” or “frequency” or “importance” before adding them together, and then divide by the total “weight” or “frequency”.</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\text{Overall mean} = \frac{350(114)+285(220)}{114+220} = \frac{102600}{334} = 307.19 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Conclude:  The mean credit card debt of all the students surveyed was about $307</p></article><article class="example example-like"><h5 class="heading">

</h5>
<p>Suppose a History course has a midterm, a final exam, and a 20 page report, and the syllabus states they have these weights in determining the final course grade:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha"><li><p>midterm - 20%;   final exam - 45%;   report - 35%.</p></li></ol>
<p>Kim’s grades in the course were these:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha"><li><p>Midterm – 82;      final exam – 89;     report – 93.</p></li></ol>
<p>Kim’s final grade in the course is found by the weighted average:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha"><li><p>(82(.20) + 89(.45) + 93(.35))/(.20+.45+.35) = 89/1.00 = 89     Kim’s final course grade is 89.</p></li></ol>
<p>Note:  If the grades were not weighted, Kim’s average would be (82 + 89 + 93)/3  =  88</p></article>
