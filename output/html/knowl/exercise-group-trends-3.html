<article class="exercise exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">9<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>Both the mean and median sales prices decreased from 2005 to 2007.

<p>What type of changes of home sales prices occurred from 2005 to 2007 so that the mean and median would change in that way?  Choose the correct statement.</p>
<p>Since both the median and mean decreased:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>In general all house prices increased</p></li>
<li><p>In general all house prices decreased</p></li>
<li><p>Only high-end home prices decreased</p></li>

<p>What type of changes of home sales prices occurred from 2005 to 2007 so that the mean and median would change in that way?  Choose the correct statement.</p>
<p>Since the mean decreased more than the median:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>All home prices decreased about the same amount</p></li>
<li><p>Low-end home prices decreased more than the high-end home prices decreased</p></li>
<li><p>High-end home prices decreased more than the low-end home prices decreased</p></li>
</ul></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">12<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<p>On the sales price graph, for the years 1999 and onward the mean sales price is greater than the median sales price (which it had been for many years).  What is new is that the difference between the mean and median prices of the homes is growing larger, especially so in the years 2003 and 2005.</p>
<p>What type of changes in housing prices in those years after 1999 would make the mean be further above the median?</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Low-end home prices increased faster than high-end home prices</p></li>
<li><p>High-end home prices increased faster than low-end home prices</p></li>
<li><p>All home prices increased at the same rate</p></li>
