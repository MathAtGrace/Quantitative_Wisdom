<p>In practice, computers are better suited for this sort of endeavor. It is always possible, however, that even a random sample might end up not being totally representative of the population.Â If we repeatedly take samples of 1000 people from among the population of likely voters in the state of Oregon, some of these samples might tend to have a slightly higher percentage of Democrats (or Republicans) than  the general population; some samples might include more older people and some samples might include more younger people; etc. This is called <em class="alert">sampling variation</em>. If there are certain groups that we want to make sure are represented, we might instead use a stratified sample.</p>
