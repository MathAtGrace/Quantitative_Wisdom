<div class="introduction">
<p>GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, can be thought of as the country’s income. It is the value of all goods and services the country produces. The national debt is how much the country owes. Just as Jeff’s spending on housing can be calculated as a percent of income, a country’s national debt can be calculated as a percent of its GDP.</p>
