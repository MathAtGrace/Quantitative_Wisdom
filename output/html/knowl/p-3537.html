<p>Daniel Webster (1782-1852) was a lawyer, congressman, Senator of Massachusetts and also served as the U.S. Secretary of State. He was from the North and did not own slaves. He was an opponent of slavery extension and he spoke against annexing Texas and against going to war with Mexico. He argued, however, that no law was needed to prevent the further extension of slavery in new states and he supported the Compromise of 1850, which disappointed his abolitionist supporters (History.com Editors, 2018b).</p>
