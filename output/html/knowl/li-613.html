<p>Suppose a middle school finds that their students are not scoring well on the stateâ€™s standardized math test. They decide to run an experiment to see if a new curriculum would improve scores. To run the test, they hire a math specialist to come in and teach a class using the new curriculum. To their delight, they see an improvement in test scores.</p>
<p>The difficulty with the last scenario is that it is not clear whether the new curriculum or the math specialist is responsible for the improvement. This is called confounding and it is the downfall of many experiments, though it is often hidden.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-data-statistical-process.html#li-613" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
