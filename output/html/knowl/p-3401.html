<p>What changes is how Jefferson assigned the remaining representatives. He said that since we ended up with an answer that is too small, our divisor must have been too big. He changed the divisor by making it smaller and looked at the new total. He would raise or lower the divisor until he found one that produced the required total. This is a trial and error process that takes some patience.</p>
