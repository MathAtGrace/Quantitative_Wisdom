<p>Not all math students know that the brain can get smarter, even though it may help them have success. And we want to get your help, so we can learn more about how to explain it to them. We're hoping you can explain--in your own words--that the brain gets smarter when people use good strategies and try hard.</p>
<p>Imagine a friend who is struggling in school. This friend used to do pretty well in school but now is having a hard time and is starting to feel dumb. Write a letter to your friend to encourage him or her—tell them about what you just learned about the brain and why they shouldn’t be discouraged.</p>
<p>For example, you can tell them:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>How they can get smarter if they work hard and use a good strategy.</p></li>
<li><p>How they should work hard to build their reading and math muscles.</p></li>
<li><p>How they are not dumb, they just need to practice using a good strategy.</p></li>
<li><p>How they can ask the teacher or other students to help them learn better ways to study. Or any other tips you have for learning in school and getting smarter.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>(Don't worry about writing a perfect final draft. We just want to know how you would say this to another student in your own words.)</p>
