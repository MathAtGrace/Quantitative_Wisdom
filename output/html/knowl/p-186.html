<p>After returning to Bangladesh he was appointed to the governmentâ€™s Planning Commission and then led the Chittagong Economics Department. In 1974, during a visit to the village of Jobra, Dr. Yunus met a woman who wove bamboo stools and was struggling to make ends meet. He loaned a total of US$27 of his own money to her and several women in the village. They repaid it in full and on time and were able to make a profit for themselves (Giridharas &amp; Bradsher, 2006).</p>
