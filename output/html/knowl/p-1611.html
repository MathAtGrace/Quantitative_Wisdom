<p>At 16, Blackwell enrolled at the University of Illinois and majored in mathematics. After three years, he graduated and continued at the university to obtain his master’s and doctorate degrees. Dr. Blackwell was given a one-year appointment as a Rosenwald Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University in 1941. It was common for Institute members to be made visiting fellows of Princeton. This created a controversy because there were no Black students enrolled at the university during that time. Princeton’s president wrote a letter to the Institute protesting Blackwell’s admission, but the Institute honored the appointment (David Harold Blackwell: National Visionary Leadership Project: African American History, 2013).</p>
