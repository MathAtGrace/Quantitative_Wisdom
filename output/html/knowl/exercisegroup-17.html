</h4>
<div class="introduction">Indiana state law says: <blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), a person may not hold or use a telecommunications device while operating a moving motor vehicle.</p>
<p>(b) A telecommunications device may be used in conjunction with hands free or voice operated technology.</p>
<p>(c) A telecommunications device may be used or held to call 911 to report a bona fide emergency.</p>
</blockquote> Is texting while driving actually a problem?  A person might spend only 4 seconds to answer a text.  How far would the car go in that time?  It depends on the car’s speed.</div>

<p>Suppose the typical texting response time is between 2 seconds and 6 seconds.  That could be written as a compound inequality for time t as:<span class="process-math">\(2\leq t \leq6\)</span> seconds.</p>
<p>If a car is travelling at 35 mph what is the typical distance a car would travel during a typical texting response?</p>
