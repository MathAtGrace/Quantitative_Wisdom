<p>Instead, the <em class="alert">Electoral College</em> was decided upon and, in this system, each state was given a certain number of electoral votes. Each state got an equal two votes for the two senate seats. This gave smaller states a leg up as they would have at least these votes. In addition, each state would be given more votes based on their population, equal to their representation in the House (Clayton, 2015). The District of Columbia, which is not a state, also gets 3 electoral votes. A candidate must win a majority of the electoral votes to win the U.S. presidency. If no candidate has a majority of electoral votes then a contingent election would be held by the U.S. House of Representatives between the three candidates with the most electoral votes.</p>
