</h4>Class 1 had a slightly higher mean (79.3 vs 78.4 points) and median (79.5 vs 78 points) and students scored higher, but some students also scored lower. It could be said that Class 1 did better. It could also be said that Class 2 did better because they have a smaller range (29 vs 44 points) and standard deviation (9.58 vs 13.34 points), so their scores were less spread out and more consistent. The lowest score in class 2 was 65. The lowest score in Class 1 was 55 points which may be an outlier due to a student having a bad day, illness or emergency, etc.</div>
