<p>There is a movement to change from the Electoral College to the popular vote. One way this is happening is through the <em class="alert">National Popular Vote Interstate Compact</em><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-80-hidden.html" title="Footnote 80"><sup> 80 </sup></a>. States who adopt this compact agree to award their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote. If states and/or D.C. with at least 270 electoral votes adopt this compact, then the winner of the popular vote would win the electoral college and the presidency. At this time there are 196 electoral votes in states and D.C. who have enacted the bill and the bill has passed one or two legislative houses in additional states with 88 electoral votes.</p>
