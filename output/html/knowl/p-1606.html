<p>Arrange for the funding of the Centennial celebration.  The total costs of the dinner party, the giant decorative cake, and the fireworks display (which is to follow the release of the balloons from the cake and is estimated to cost $25,000) are to be covered by the Centennial Fund.  Plan A is to get a donor to deposit enough money this year so that with interest payments, the accumulated balance in 2048 will fully cover all the costs.  (Note: You are NOT to actually contact any potential donors!  Just calculate how much money would need to be invested now to pay for the party and related expenses.)  If Plan A doesn’t work, there’s Plan B: set aside donations each month starting next September so that costs will be covered.  You need to describe each of these plans and explain the calculations.</p>
