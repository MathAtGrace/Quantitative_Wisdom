</h4>
<div class="introduction">When you use a credit card, you can pay off the entire balance at the end of the month and avoid paying any interest. If you do not pay the full amount, you are borrowing money from the credit card company. This is called credit card debt. Many people in the United States are concerned about the amount of credit card debt for both individuals and for society in general. In this lesson, you will use skills and ideas from previous lessons to think about some issues related to credit cards. You may want to refer back to the previous lessons.</div>
