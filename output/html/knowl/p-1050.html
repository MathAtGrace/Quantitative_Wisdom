<p>Installment loans are also called <em class="alert">amortized loans</em>. They are designed so that the payment amount remains the same over the life (term) of the loan. In order for that amount to remain constant, the amount of money going towards paying the <em class="alert">principal</em> (amount owed) and towards the <em class="alert">interest</em> will vary. At the beginning of the loan, the amount owed is the largest. So, at the beginning the amount of interest charged will also be the largest. As the loan gets repaid the amount owed is reduced and therefore the interest is reduced. Therefore, at the beginning of an installment loan payments go mostly towards the interest, towards the end the payments are going mostly towards the principal.</p>
