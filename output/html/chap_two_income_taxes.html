</h3>
<p id="p-1351">Although Benjamin Franklin famously claimed in 1789 that “in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes”, it wasn’t until 1913 that the 16th amendment was ratified, and income tax was legalized. Prior to this, taxes were primarily collected through tariffs on imported goods, poll taxes, and property taxes. A <em class="alert">poll tax</em>, also referred to as a head tax, was a fixed amount every liable individual had to pay. Payment of the poll tax was often required before a person could register to vote or be issued a hunting or fishing license.</p>
<p id="p-1352">Tax policy in the United States is a politically divisive issue. There is even debate as to the current length of the tax code! Some claim that the code is over 70,000 pages while others insist it is just over 2,000. Nevertheless, there is at least one thing everyone can agree with - you don't want to be on the wrong side of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)!</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-35"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">3.7.2</span> <span class="title">Types of Income Tax</span>
</h3>
<p id="p-1353"><em class="alert">Income tax</em> is a tax that is levied on earned income or profit. Income taxes are collected by the federal government, states, and even some municipalities. Income taxes are an important source of funding, and are used to finance social programs, maintain and expand infrastructure, and provide foreign aid, among other things.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-36"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">3.7.3</span> <span class="title">Federal Income Tax</span>
</h3>
<p id="p-1354">Anyone who earns income over a certain amount (approximately $10,000 for an individual) must file a federal tax return and have taxes collected on their behalf. The amount of federal tax owed is determined by your <em class="alert">filing status</em> and <em class="alert">taxable income</em>.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-37"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">3.7.4</span> <span class="title">State Income Tax</span>
</h3>
<p id="p-1355">Forty-one states and the District of Columbia collect taxes on income from wages and investment. Seven states - Washington, Nevada, South Dakota, Wyoming, Alaska, Texas, and Florida – do not collect tax on wage or investment income, and two states – New Hampshire and Tennessee – only collect tax on investment income. The amount of tax collected varies by state, with each state averaging between $500 and $3000 per person.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-38"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">3.7.5</span> <span class="title">Municipal Income Tax</span>
</h3>
<p id="p-1356">Some municipalities (urban districts) also collect income taxes. For example, business owners in Multnomah County pay a municipal tax on their business income, and workers in the Tri-met district (area served by Tri-met) have their wages taxed at 0.7537%.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-39"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<p id="p-1357">Not all income is taxed, and not all income that gets taxed is taxed at the same rate. The general process of calculating the amount of federal income tax you owe is outlined in the chart below.</p>
<figure class="figure figure-like" id="figure-7"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/financial_math/2_5/calculating_federal.png" class="contained" alt="Five rectangles showing the steps: 1. Calculate gross income by adding all income; 2. Calculate adjusted gross income (AGI) by subtracting any pre-tax adjustments; 3. Calculate taxable income by subtracting deductions (itemized or standard); 4. Calculate tax using tax table for your filing status; 5. Calculate refund or amount owed by subtracting credits and withholdings. If the amount is negative you get a refund; if the amount is positive you owe money."></div>

<p id="p-1358"><em class="alert">Gross income</em> includes all wages, tips, earned interest, dividends, rents and royalties, alimony, property gains, income tax refunds, etc. Keep in mind that ALL income means ALL income. Even income earned from a crime must be reported!</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-41"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">3.7.8</span> <span class="title">Adjusted Gross Income</span>
</h3>
<p id="p-1359"><em class="alert">Adjustments</em> are eligible expenses used to reduce your gross income. Adjustments are tax-exempt and thus reduce the amount owed in taxes. Eligible expenses include contributions to tax deferred savings plans (401k, Individual Retirement Plan (IRA)), school tuition, student loan interest, moving expenses, business expenses, flexible spending accounts and health savings account contributions.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-42"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">3.7.9</span> <span class="title">Taxable Income</span>
</h3>
<p id="p-1360"><em class="alert">Taxable income</em> is determined by subtracting your <em class="alert">deductions</em> from your adjusted gross income. You may choose to take <em class="emphasis">either</em> a <em class="alert">standard deduction</em>, which is determined by your filing status, or you may choose to <em class="alert">itemize</em> your deductions. Itemized deductions may include state and local income taxes, property taxes, medical expenses, mortgage interest, and charitable donations.</p>
<p id="p-1361">Prior to the 2018 tax year, you could also claim <em class="alert">personal exemptions</em>. Exemptions of $4,050 for each member of the household were subtracted from the adjusted gross income along with either the standard or itemized deduction to determine taxable income. Starting in 2018, however, the standard deduction was doubled, and personal exemptions were eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-1362">Let’s look at an example of how to calculate gross income and adjusted gross income (AGI).</p>

<p id="p-1383">The United States has a <em class="alert">progressive</em> federal income tax system which means the more income you have, the more you generally pay in taxes. There are <em class="alert">marginal tax rates</em> that go up according to our income, but we don’t pay the same rate on all of our income. The ranges of income are called <em class="alert">tax brackets</em> and the buckets in the illustration below can help us visualize the brackets.</p>
<p id="p-1384">The cutoff values in the figure are for a married couple filing jointly, but the percentages are the same for everyone as you’ll see in the table on the next page. We pay 10% of any taxable income in the first bucket. If the first bucket is full, we move to the second bucket and we pay 12% of that income. This couple is in the 22% tax bracket because the 3rd bucket is partially filled. They will pay 22% of the income in that bucket, but they are not paying 22% of their entire income.</p>

<p id="p-1388">We begin with the lowest tax bracket and take 10% of $9,525. Since their income is higher than that, we add 12% of the next amount, found by subtracting the values in that bracket. Avery’s taxable income is in the 22% tax bracket, so we find the amount over $38,700 by subtracting. Here is the full calculation:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="" id="md-71">

<p id="p-1390">Avery would owe $8,043.50 in taxes. Note that their overall tax rate is somewhere between 10% and 22%. We can calculate the actual rate by dividing their tax owed by their taxable income:</p>

For this reason, we can simplify these tax tables. The tax tables below give the value for all of the lower tax buckets that are full. There is a tax table for each filing status and the cutoffs are regularly adjusted for inflation, so they usually vary from year to year.</p>

Notice the number $12,698 is the same value we got for all of the “full” tax brackets, so we only need to calculate the last one.

</h3>
<p id="p-1409">Employers are required to take out an estimated amount for taxes from each of our paychecks. These withholdings are taken out, so we don’t all have huge tax bills at the end of the year, and so the government has the income it needs to run. When you file your taxes, you compare the amount of tax you actually owe, with the withholdings from your paycheck. If you had more withheld during the year than you owe, you will file for a refund. If your withholdings were less, though, you must pay the difference. Let’s look at a couple of examples with tax credits and withholdings.</p>
